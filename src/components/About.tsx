      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I am <strong>Sankalpa Sovan Samal</strong>, an M.Sc. Computer Science
        student with a strong academic background and a growing passion for
        technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. My primary areas
        of interest include Computer Networks, Internet of Things (IoT), and Web
        Development, where I enjoy exploring how software systems interact to
        solve real-world problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a solid understanding
        of core computer science concepts such as data structures, networking
        fundamentals, operating systems, and database management. Along with
        theoretical knowledge, I strongly believe in practical learning and
        hands-on experience. I actively work on projects that help me apply
        classroom concepts to real-life applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a keen interest in frontend and full-stack web development, with
        experience in building responsive and user-friendly applications using
        technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and TypeScript. I
        enjoy creating clean user interfaces, improving user experience, and
        ensuring performance and accessibility across devices.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to web development, I am deeply interested in Computer
        Networks and IoT technologies. Learning about routing protocols,
        networking architectures, and device communication has enhanced my
        analytical thinking and understanding of how large-scale and embedded
        systems function together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond technical skills, I value discipline, adaptability, and teamwork.
        I believe effective communication and collaboration are essential for
        successful project development. I am always eager to learn new
        technologies, accept feedback, and continuously improve my skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        My long-term goal is to grow as a skilled computer science professional
        and contribute to meaningful software solutions that create real impact.
        I am motivated by curiosity and driven by the desire to keep learning
        and evolving in the fast-changing world of technology.
